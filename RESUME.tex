\section{Experience}
\runsubsection{IBM}
\descript{| Backend Developer }
\location{Oct 2024 – Present | Bangalore, India}
\vspace{\topsep}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Contributing to IBM Cloud Networking (IaaS) organization across teams including Private DNS, Load Balancer as a Service (LBaaS), and Developer Experience (UI, CLI, Terraform, SDK).
\item Migrated Private DNS control path storage from ETCD to Redis by designing a polling-based mechanism to replace ETCD’s native watch events, enabling reliable state monitoring.
\item Analyzed and implemented strategies for migrating appliance-based PDNS systems (provisioned on VSI) to Redis while ensuring minimal disruption to dependent components.
\item Designed and developed \textbf{Phoenix}, a recovery microservice for LBaaS that enables immediate recovery of stuck load balancers, reducing reliance on manual recovery processes and periodic Jenkins jobs.
\item Integrated admin APIs into the operations dashboard to simplify token management and API queries, reducing manual SRE efforts.
\item Enhanced Developer Experience by maintaining client tools: \textbf{UI (React + Express)}, \textbf{CLI (Go)}, \textbf{Terraform provider (Go)}, and \textbf{SDKs} (Java, Python, Go, JavaScript) for networking services.

\runsubsection{Silvertouch Technologies}
\descript{| Software Development Engineer }
\location{Jan 2024 – Oct 2024 | Ahmedabad, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Completed 6-month internship training across multiple technologies including Spring Boot, React, Angular, iOS (Swift), and Flutter, building adaptability and rapid learning skills to quickly contribute to varied projects.
\item Designed and implemented asynchronous and atomic integration between HRMS (Java) and Odoo Accounting module to ensure accurate event-based accounting entries (claims, loans, salaries) without duplicate processing.
\item Optimized HRMS admin dashboards by consolidating multiple queries into database views, reducing page load time from 10–15 seconds to under 1 second.
\item Co-developed a production database sanitization script for a 1200+ table HRMS schema, leveraging ON-DELETE CASCADE to safely remove dummy users and associated data without affecting real users.
