\vspace{\topsep} % Hacky fix for awkward extra vertical space
\begin{tightemize}

\item i'm part of networking org in ibm cloud which comes under IAAS
\item so, worked across teams like Private DNS, LBaaS and DevX ( ui, cli, tf, sdk team)
\item PDNS ETCD to REDIS
\item i worked with Private DNS (PDNS) team.
\item Private DNS Control path uses ETCD, then team decided to move to REDIS. ETCD has lot of native features like watch events, which is not there in REDIS so we decided to go with polling
\item PDNS is also appliance based meaning it provisions VSI (VM on ibm cloud) to monitor VSI there is a concept of lease which is monitored by other components.as there are lot of moving piece depending on ETCD, so graceful migration to REDIS was not easy

\item Phoenix
\item i worked with Load Balancer As a Service (LBaaS).
\item load balancer is installed as an application in VSI (VM on ibm cloud), so to provision and configure it there are lot of steps and activities. often LB is stuck in some state and we have to recover it.
there is one manual way to recover, there is one jenkins job also which runs after every 30 mins and tries to recover all stuck LBs.
\item but we developed one recovery microservice called phoenix which will perform immedeate recovery of the stuck LB. i was part of this new microservice from the POC and design discussion stage and worked on it

% \item trusted profile integration
\item OPS dashboard
\item integrated admin apis of one service into the ops dashboard
\item reducing the SRE efforts to query iam service to get access token and formulate the curl command with appropriate payload etc. now just simply use the ops dashboard
\item UI CLI TF SDK
\item UI -> React + Express, CLI -> GO, TF -> Go, SDK in all languages java,python,go, javascript
\item worked on client side things like UI CLI TF SDK, any services in networking org releases the feature we update the UI CLI TF SDK of that particular service

\descript{| SDE }
\location{Jun 2024 – Oct 2024 | Ahmedabad, India}
\begin{tightemize}
\item Accounting Module
\item i was working on HRMS project which had some events for which accounting entry needs to be made in ODOO's accounting module ( a different team ) i.e claim, loan, salary etc.
\item so i alone was given responsibility to develop integration between our HRMS(java team) and Odoo (odoo team)
\item i developed an asynchronous and atomic system to propogate accounting info to odoo api's so we do not process the same transcation multiple times and dont block the main thread
\item Dashboard optimization
\item admin dashboards comprises of lot of info that is coming from many different database tables and shown on a single page, so initially page was taking around 10-15 seconds to load because multiple database calls were happening to gather all the data that is required, i created database views by joining the required tables and updated the api to get all the data in one DB call reducing the dashboard loading time to less then 1 second
\item Production database sanitization
\item before our staging infra was setup team used to test on prod env because of which there was a lot of dummy data in prod database.
\item so me and one other collgue was given task to clean the prod database safely. there were around 1200 database tables, as this was an HRMS application users table was the main table which was referenced in almost all of the other tables, so we wrote a script that will add ON-DELETE CASCADE to all the forieng key contraint ( to user talbe) of all tables then we will delete all the users that are not present in actual users list (this was given to us by client), this will delete all the dummy user and all corresponding dummy data from all the tables, and then script would remove ON DELETE CASCADE from the tables

\descript{| Intern }
\location{Jan 2024 – Jun 2024 | Ahmedabad, India}
\begin{tightemize}
% \item Studied Spring Boot and Java, focusing on microservices, RESTful APIs, and enterprise-level design.
% \item Gained experience in iOS development, learning Swift and using Xcode.
% \item Learned the MERN stack, covering full-stack development.
\item During 6 months of my internship we were trained on various different technologies. every month we would be trained in new technology. so, i worked with Spring Boot, React, Angular, iOS, Flutter etc. the main thing i learnt there was not any framework or language but a skill that is how to learn and adapt quickly. so, because of that i am really good at picking up something new and quickly start working on it
